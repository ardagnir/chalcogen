Chalcogen
===========

Full vim integration in atom.
(Currently in proof-of-concept stage)

The elements in column VI of the periodic table are called the chalcogens. If the atoms around you didn't include chalcogens, you'd die.

##Requirements
- Chalcogen requires Shadowvim, Atom and Vim(your version needs to have +clientserver).
- Chalcogen works best in GNU/Linux.
- Chalcogen also works in OSX, but doing so requires XQuartz. *(This is a requirement of vim's +clientserver functionality.)*

##Setup
*Still being stabalized*

##How it works
Chalcogen runs an actual vim instance in the background and routes keystrokes through vim.

##Bugs
There's a lot. Chalcogen is unfinished and so is Atom.

##License
AGPL v3
